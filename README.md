1.	Artemis financial is looking for a RESTful API to protect from outside threats to their banking software. They are a banking company and were having issues keeping their software secure from malicious attacks.
2.	I would say I did well with the manual code review. I found a few issues with their initial code that could have caused major damage to the company. Coding securely is very important as there are many valuable digital assets. Most monetary transactions are done digitally and with things like crypto currency there is a lot of money to be stolen in the digital space. This adds a layer of protection to customer information and protects the company from the backlash or financial loss of a major hack.
3.	Understanding the vulnerability assessment was challenging for me. The initial summary was not very helpful but once I read each code description, I became a lot more confident.
4.	Implementing a RESTful API increased the security a lot by adding a defense between the server and all clients. A dependency check seems like a very useful tool Iâ€™d like to use more in the future. It is an amazing tool to check software for vulnerabilities very quickly.
5.	I made certain by thoroughly reviewing my code to make sure there were no mistakes. This alone helps a lot with preventing vulnerabilities. As well I made sure that all plugins were up to date. After refactoring I did a manual review and another dependency check.
6.	GeeksForGeeks was a great resource for me that helped a lot in understanding assignments. 
7.	Creating a RESTful API is something I would certainly put on my resume. As well as using a hash cipher to encrypt a program.
